Palindrome Check Program

This is a simple program that checks if a given string is palindromic.

Steps to use:
1. Enter a string when prompted.
2. The program will determine if it reads the same forward and backward.
3. It will display whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Try it out with words like 'racecar', 'level' or a 'kayak'!
